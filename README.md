# Driverless Car Object Detection üöóüßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A deep learning computer vision project that detects humans and other objects in images, generating bounding boxes for each detected object. Built for driverless car applications, this project uses a pretrained **Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 FPN** model on the COCO dataset to demonstrate object detection in real-world scenarios.

## Features ‚ú®

- Detects **humans, vehicles, and other key objects** in images.  
- Outputs **bounding boxes** with class labels and confidence scores.  
- Uses **pretrained COCO weights** for robust detection.  
- Can process **single images or batches**.  
- Includes detailed **documentation with accuracy, metrics, and sample predictions**.
